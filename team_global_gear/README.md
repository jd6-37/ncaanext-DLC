# Team Global Gear Replacements
This directory contains team-color/branded equipment (eg. gloves) that can be used on a per user installation basis to replace global equipment such as Taped Hand, Taped Wrist, and Rubber Pad. 

Activate these by downloading them and putting them in your `replacements > user-customs` folder. See below for detailed steps and important info. Feel free to organize your user-customs folder however you like, but remember, the emulator doesn't care about folder structure. It only cares that the file is somewhere in `replacements` and the filename is unique across the entire `replacements` folder.

Note: Replacing these gear items are GLOBAL changes and apply to every player on every team. However, although they are global, the NEXT mod has "discontinued" these equipment items (Taped Hand, Taped Wrist, and Rubber Pad). Meaning, there are no players using this gear in the base roster, and if you start a dynasty, you’ll never see players on opposing teams with this gear because we made it so the CPU never assigns this gear to recuits. Therefore, although this is global gear, it is “safe” to use for your custom team color gear in dynasty mode. 

## Gloves
In addition to the default glove, you can utilize up to two custom team-color gloves by replacing the Taped Hand texture and/or the Taped Wrist texture.  

### Taped Hand –> Custom Glove
Download a glove texture PNG from `TeamName > custom-gloves-taped-hands` and put it in your PCSX2 textures folder at `SLUS-21214 > replacements > user-customs > custom-gloves-taped-hands`. The file should be named exactly: `703755b32d90480f-c9ca9c6780a74ae3-000059d3.png`. As of NEXT V14, there is no default replacement in the mod you need to disable, so that's all that's required to use the custom glove. To use the glove, in the player equipment edit screen, change the hand gear to "Taped".

### Taped Wrist –> Custom Glove #2
There is a caveat to this one. When using Taped Wrist, in addition to the custom glove, the game will always automatcally use the white wristband/tape wrist equipment. So, you can’t use this in conjunction with the shooeter sleeves or any other wrist gear, only White Wrist. Therefore, it is recommended that you first utilize the TAPED HAND replacement, and then use this replacement method if you want an additional custom glove.  Download the **two** glove textures PNGs from `TeamName > custom-gloves-taped-wrist` and put them both in your PCSX2 textures folder at `SLUS-21214 > replacements > user-customs > custom-gloves-taped-wrist`. There should be two identical PNG files with different names. The files should be named exactly: `703755b32d90480f-40a0ffac36362a76-000059d3.png` and `703755b32d90480f-fd8165f9fd9056e9-000059d3.png`. As of NEXT V14, there is no default replacement in the mod you need to disable, so that's all that's required to use the custom glove. To use the glove, in the player equipment edit screen, change the wrist gear to "Taped".

## Upper Arm/Elbow
The "Rubber Pad" elbow equipment is another global item that is safe to replace with custom team-color gear. The texture actually covers the entire upper arm from the middle of the elbow all the way up to the edge of the sleeve, so you can replace it with a team-color short sleeve undershirt, an upper arm tattoo, wristband, or whatever you like. In the DLC repo you will find custom short sleeve undershirts that are ready to use.

### Rubber Pad –> Custom Upper Arm
Download an undershirt texture PNG from `TeamName > custom-undershirt-rubber-pad` and put it in your PCSX2 textures folder at `SLUS-21214 > replacements > user-customs > custom-undershirt-rubber-pad`. The file should be named exactly: `3a30272f374c5d47-dfc7df6e50c2d5c1-00005993.png`. **IMPORTANT: You must remove or disable the mod's default Rubber Pad replacement** located at `replacements > general > gear`. You can simply prepend the filename with a dash to disable it. To use your new custom replacement, in the player equipment edit screen, change the elbow gear to "Rubber Pad".
